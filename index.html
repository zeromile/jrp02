        <h1>Job Readiness Program, Phase 1 Syllabus</h1>
        <h2>West Hills College and Geekwise Academy</h2>
        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p> Phase 1 of the Job Readiness Program is an intensive-instruction class, designed to further develop existing web development skills already learned in the West Hills College CTE program. Because students will have this base knowledge there won’t
            be a need for Geekwise to cover these topics in detail. However, the initial part of Phase 1 will require instructor and students to review HTML, CSS and Javascript to assess students’ skill and aptitude in these areas. Post review, students
            will delve further into Javascript and MEAN Stack. Some students may still need to be brought up to speed on the basics and we will do our best to accommodate. </p>
        <h3>Course Technology</h3>
        <p> Students will be required to bring their own laptop computer. The computer must be in good working condition able to run the latest browser and editing software. We will primarily use the Chrome browser, Git version control and the Atom text editor.
            Student must have “Administrator” privileges in order to install software. </p>
        <h3>Computer Usage</h3>
        <p> In order to stay focused, please refrain from activities that are distracting to yourself and others around you. Everyone should have an equal opportunity to learn in a distraction-free environment. </p>
        <h3>Classroom Behavior Expectations</h3>
        <ul>
